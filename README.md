# Anomally-based-IDS-using-machine-learning-
The Goal was to use machine learning algorithms for predicting network and web attacks.
This project is more of a prototype, than a final working product.

# Model Used
The Intrusion Detector is built using Decision Trees, Naive Bayes and Random Forest algorithms which is trained specifically for each individual type of attacks

# Dataset Used
Dataset we used to achieve this goal is UNSW-NB15 dataset. Dataset contains network traffic data during normal traffic and during execution of different attacks.

# How to Run?
Run the file unsw-nb15-ids.ipynb in an IPython Notebook, to trace step by step analysis of what code does
